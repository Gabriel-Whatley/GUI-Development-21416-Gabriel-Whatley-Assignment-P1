Visual Studio 2022
Issues: If you rename (Using the properties browser) the form that automatically created with a new project in VS2022 (named "Form1") the changes are not propagated throughout the project automatically. I had to rename some of the  project files and edit the Me.MainForm variable in Application.Designer.vb file to match the name that I changed the form from. After that it worked, seems to be a bug a lot of other people have had with VS2022 but MS haven't fixed it yet. In the future I may just leave the name of the initial form as "Form1" so I can avoid messing with it.
